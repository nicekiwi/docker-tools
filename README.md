# Docker Tools

My collection of wrappers to run tools via Docker.

> TL;DR Don't use PHP Extensions in VS Code requiring a local PHP executable. Use https://intelephense.com/ instead, it's worth paying for. Ext: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client.

## Supports

- PHP 7.4
- PHP 8.0
- Composer 2
- Laravel Installer
- NodeJS LTS 14

Run

```
./setup.sh
```
