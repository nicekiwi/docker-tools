# Docker Tools for Visual Studio Code

My collection of wrappers to run tools via Docker in VSCode.

## Supports

- PHP 7.4
- PHP 8.0
- Composer 2
- Laravel Installer
- NodeJS LTS 14

Run

```
./setup.sh
```

I can then add the `~/code/docker-tools/bin` path to `$PATH` and/or set the VS Code path(s) to one of the printed paths.
